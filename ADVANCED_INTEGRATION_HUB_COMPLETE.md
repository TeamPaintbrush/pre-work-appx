- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses EventEmitter for real-time updates
- **Type-Safe Configuration**: TypeScript interfaces for all integration types
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new integrations and capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

### Webhook Security
- **Signature Verification**: HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- **Timestamp Validation**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Provider-Specific Logic**: Tailored handling for each webhook provider
- **Rate Limiting Ready**: Infrastructure for rate limiting implementation

### SSO Implementation
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: SAML, OAuth2, OpenID Connect
- **Secure Token Handling**: Proper token management and validation
